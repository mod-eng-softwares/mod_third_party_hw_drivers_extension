# DS3231M - RTC 10 Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This example project shows an example of Mikroe RTC 10 Click board driver integration with the Silicon Labs Platform.

RTC 10 Click is a real-time clock module which has an extremely low power consumption, allowing it to be used with a single button cell battery, for an extended period of time. It features the DS3231M, a low-cost, extremely accurate, I2C real-time clock (RTC) from Analog Devices. The device incorporates a battery input and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device and reduces the piecepart count in a manufacturing line.

This example can be used to demonstrate the capability of maintaining timekeeping of the Mikroe RTC 10 Click board.

## Hardware Connection ##

The Silicon Labs Explorer Kit boards feature a mikroBUS™ socket, allowing the RTC 10 Click board to connect easily via the mikroBUS header. Ensure that the 45-degree corner of the RTC 10 Click board aligns with the 45-degree white line on the Explorer Kit. The hardware connection is illustrated in the image below.

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a mikroBUS™ socket, consider using the Wire Jumpers.

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by *rtc*.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - DS3231M - RTC10 Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for the your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the app.c file (located in the `app/example/mikroe_rtc10_ds3231m` folder) into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Explorer Kit is used:**
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: **vcom**
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Clock & Timing] → [DS3231M - RTC 10 Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2] → Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Clock & Timing] → [DS3231M - RTC 10 Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

### Driver Layer Diagram ###

### Testing ###

This example sets time and date for the RTC Click in the initialization step. And then it starts tracking the time and display it every one second. The temperature is displayed every 60 seconds.

You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below.
