- 1x [Environment 2 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/environment-2-click) based on SHT40 & SGP40

## Hardware Connection ##

The Silicon Labs Explorer Kit boards feature a mikroBUS™ socket, allowing the Environment 2 Click board to connect easily via the mikroBUS header. Ensure that the 45-degree corner of the Environment 2 Click board aligns with the 45-degree white line on the Explorer Kit. The hardware connection is illustrated in the image below.

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a mikroBUS™ socket, consider using the Wire Jumpers.

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

**Silicon Labs BLE Explorer Kit:**

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I2C_SDA | PD3 | PD3 | PB5 | PD3 | ↔ | SDA |
| I2C_SCL | PD2 | PD2 | PB4 | PD2 | ↔ | SCL |

**Silicon Labs Wi-Fi Development Kit:**

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by 'sht40' and 'sgp40'.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - SHT40 &amp; SGP40 - Environment 2 Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_environment2_sht40_sgp40/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Explorer Kit is used:**
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [SHT40 & SGP40 - Environment 2 Click (Mikroe)] → using default configuration

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2] → Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [SHT40 & SGP40 - Environment 2 Click (Mikroe)] → using default configuration

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

This is an example that demonstrates the use of the Environment 2 Click board. Measured and display air quality (raw data), temperature (degrees Celsius), relative humidity (%) and VOC Index. Results are being sent to the USART Terminal where you can track their changes.
You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below.

## Report Bugs & Get Support ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo.
