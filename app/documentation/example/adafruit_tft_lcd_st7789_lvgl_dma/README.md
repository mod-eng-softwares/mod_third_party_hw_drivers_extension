## Summary ##

This example shows an example for integrating the ST7789 display with the [LVGL library](https://lvgl.io/).
There are several settings to adjust the number draw buffers and buffering/refreshing modes in the LVGL library. For more information, please refer to [this documemtation](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/porting/display.html#buffering-modes).

This example uses the source files which are generated from [SquareLine Studio](https://squareline.io/). These files are provided in the `app_ui` folder. SquareLine Studio is a professional and easy-to-use UI editor software to speed up and simplify the UI development. Visiting [this page](https://squareline.io/) for more information.

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your board to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by **"st7789"**.

2. Click **Create** button on the example:

   - **Third Party Hardware Drivers - ST7789 - TFT LCD Display (Adafruit) - with LVGL + DMA**

   Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for the "EFR32xG24 Explorer Kit Board" or "SiWx917-RB4338A Radio Board" using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy source files:
   - With Gecko EFR32 SOCs:
     - Copy the file `app/example/adafruit_tft_lcd_st7789_lvgl_dma/gecko/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).
   - With SiWx917 SoCs:
     - Copy the file `app/example/adafruit_tft_lcd_st7789_lvgl_dma/si91x/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).
   - Copy the `app/example/adafruit_tft_lcd_st7789_lvgl_dma/app_ui` folder and all the files in it into the project root folder.

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **With Gecko EFR32 SOCs:**
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Platform] → [Driver] → [LED] → [Simple LED] → [led0, led1]
     - [Platform] → [Driver] → [Button] → [Simple Button] → [btn0, btn1]
   - **With SiWx917 SoCs:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Power Manager] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [MCU] → [Hardware] → [LED] → [led0, led1]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [MCU] → [Hardware] → [Button] → [btn0, btn1]
   - [Application] → [Utility] → [Assert]
   - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Display & LED] → [ST7789 - TFT LCD Display (Adafruit) - SPI with DMA]
   - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Services] → [LVGL - Graphic Library] → Using settings as below:
     ![lvgl_config](image/lvgl_config.png)

4. Enable DMA support for SPI module (for SiWx917 SoCs)

   To improve SPI transfer speed, enable DMA support by changing configuration of GSPI component at: **[WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91X] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [GSPI]** as the picture bellow

5. Build and flash the project to your device.

## How It Works ##

### Testing ###

After the chip is started, the main program is launched. The main screen will appear with the Silabs logo and 2 LED status icons. The user presses 2 buttons on the board to change the status of the LED. BTN0 is used to control LED0, BTN1 is used to control LED1. The status of the LED on the board is synced with the status of the LED on the screen.
