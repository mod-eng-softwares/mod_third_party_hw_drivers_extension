# BTHome v2 - Server #

## Overview ##

![logo](image/logo.png)

BTHome is an energy-efficient, but flexible BT format for devices to broadcast their sensor data and button presses.

Devices can run over a year on a single battery. It allows data encryption and is supported by popular home automation platforms, like Home Assistant, out of the box.

For more information, please visit [BThome](https://bthome.io/).

This project aims to implement a Server/Gateway library that facilitates the scanning and discovery of BTHome devices.

The vision of this development effort is to create a Server/Gateway library that simplifies the process of integrating BTHome devices into IoT setups. By enabling users to easily discover, add, and visualize BTHome devices' measured values, we aim to enhance the accessibility and usability of BTHome technology in various IoT projects.

## Required Hardware ##

- 1x [Silicon Labs BLE Development Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth). For simplicity, Silicon Labs recommends the [BGM220-EK4314A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth/bgm220-explorer-kit)

- 1x [BGM220-EK4314A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth/bgm220-explorer-kit) running the [**BTHome v2**](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/tree/master/app/documentation/example/bthome_v2) example

## Hardware Connection ##

The hardware connection is shown in the image below:

## Setup ##

To test this application, you can either create a project based on an example project or start with a "Bluetooth - SoC Empty" project based on your hardware.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your hardware to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project with the filter "bthome".

2. Click **Create** button on **Third Party Hardware Drivers - BTHome v2 - Server** examples. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create a **Bluetooth - SoC Empty** project for your hardware using Simplicity Studio 5.

2. Copy all source and header files in `app/example/bthome_v2_server` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Open the `.slcp` file, go to the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - [Third-Party Hardware Drivers] → [Services] → [BTHome v2 - Server]
   - [Services] → [Command Line Interface] → [CLI Instance(s)] → default instance name: inst
   - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
   - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]

   **Unistall the following components:**
   - [Bluetooth] → [Application] → [Firmware Update] → [In-Place OTA DFU]
   - [Platform] → [Bootloader] → [Utils] → [Bootloader Application Interface]

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash the project to your device.

## How It Works ##

The library offers functionality to scan for BTHome devices and display their measured values, such as temperature and humidity. The goal is to simplify the process of adding BTHome devices to IoT setups and visualize their data in a user-friendly manner.

The example implements a CLI Interface that provide some features:

- Scan BLE network and list BTHome devices. List them with the following parameters:
  - MAC - Object ID - Encryption (Yes/No) - Encryption Key Available (Yes/No)
- List registered devices
  - MAC - Encryption Key
- Register key by MAC
- Remove key by MAC
- Add device to the interested devices by MAC
- Remove device from the interested devices by MAC
- Start BTHome monitor : Periodically update the measured values for the interested devices in the console
  - MAC - Encryption (Yes/No) - Encryption Key Available (Yes/No) - Object ID - Measurement Data

## Testing ##

1. Open a console or a terminal program (e.g., Tera Term) and connect to the device to see the logs.

2. To see the supported commands: `help`

   ![help](image/help.png)

3. Start scanning to find BThome v2 devices: `scan start`

   ![scan_start](image/scan_start.png)

4. Register encryption key for device: `key_register <MAC ADDR> <KEY>`

   ![key](image/key.png)

5. Add a device to the interested devices to check the data: `interested_add <MAC ADDR>`

6. To observe the data of device in the interested list: `monitor start`
