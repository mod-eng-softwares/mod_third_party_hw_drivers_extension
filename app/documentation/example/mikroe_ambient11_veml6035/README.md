## Hardware Connection ##

The Silicon Labs Explorer Kit boards feature a mikroBUS™ socket, allowing the Ambient 11 Click board to connect easily via the mikroBUS header. Ensure that the 45-degree corner of the Ambient 11 Click board aligns with the 45-degree white line on the Explorer Kit. The hardware connection is illustrated in the image below.

![board](image/hardware_connection.png)

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a mikroBUS™ socket, consider using the Wire Jumpers.

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

**Silicon Labs BLE Explorer Kit:**

| Description | BRD4314A | BRD4108A | BRD2703A | BRD2710A | ↔ | Ambient 11 Click |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I2C_SDA | PD3 | PD3 | PB5 | PD3 | ↔ | SDA |
| I2C_SCL | PD2 | PD2 | PB4 | PD2 | ↔ | SCL |

**Silicon Labs Wi-Fi Development Kit:**

| Description | BRD4338A + BRD4002A | BRD2605A | BRD2708A | ↔ | Ambient 11 Click |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I2C_SDA | ULP_GPIO_6 [EXP_16] | ULP_GPIO_6 [P16] | GPIO_6 | ↔ | SDA |
| I2C_SCL | ULP_GPIO_7 [EXP_15] | ULP_GPIO_7 [P15] | GPIO_7 | ↔ | SCL |

> [!NOTE]
> The VEML6035 is already present on [SiWx917-DK2605A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-dk2605a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-dev-kit) as an on-board peripheral, and occupies the same I2C lines to connect to the SiWG917 I2C bus, hence no need for using an external one.

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your board to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project with filtering by *ambient 11*.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - Ambient 11 Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

   ![Create_example](image/create_example.png)

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_ambient11_veml6035/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Explorer Kit is used:**
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
     - [Platform] → [Driver] → [I2C] → [I2CSPM] → instance name: mikroe
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [VEML6035 - Ambient 11 Click (Mikroe)]

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2] → Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [VEML6035 - Ambient 11 Click (Mikroe)]

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

After you flashed the code to your board and powered the connected boards, the application starts running automatically.
The application demonstrates the measurement of the lux value via I2C interface every second. The lux is the unit of illuminiance, or luminious flux per unit area. Results are being sent to the USART Terminal where you can track their changes. You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below.

## Report Bugs & Get Support ##

To report bugs in the Application Examples projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo. Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of [third_party_hw_drivers_extension](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) repo.
