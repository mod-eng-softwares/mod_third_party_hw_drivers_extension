# TSD-10 - Turbidity Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This project shows the implementation of a Turbidity driver using Turbidity Click and TSD10 sensor with the Silicon Labs Platform.

Turbidity Click Bundle: This bundle gives you everything you need to take high-accuracy turbidity measurements. It allows users to combine Turbidity Sensor with Turbidity Click via an additional 3-wire Male to Male Cable - 15 cm to measure the relative clarity of any liquid. Turbidity Click allows users to upgrade their projects with a sensor that senses the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles invisible to the naked eye.

The sensor can be used in various domains. For example, with the washing machines application, depending on the sensor value, the washing controller can determine the amount of soil in the water and make decisions on how long to wash in all cycles. By measuring the turbidity of the wash water, the washing machine can conserve energy on lightly soiled loads by only washing as long as necessary. This will result in energy savings for the consumer.

## Hardware Connection ##

The Silicon Labs Explorer Kit boards feature a mikroBUS™ socket, allowing the Turbidity Click board to connect easily via the mikroBUS header. Ensure that the 45-degree corner of the IrThermo 3 board aligns with the 45-degree white line on the Explorer Kit.

The Turbidity Click features a 1x3 2.5mm connector suitable for connecting a Turbidity sensor via an additional 3-wire Male to Male Cable - 15 cm.

The hardware connection is illustrated in the image below.

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a mikroBUS™ socket, consider using the Wire Jumpers.

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your board to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project with the filter 'turbidity'.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - TSD-10 - Turbidity Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

   ![Create_example](image/create_example.png)

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_turbidity_tsd10/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Development Kit is used:**
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
     - [Third-Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensor] → [TSD-10 - Turbidity Click (Mikroe)]

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2] → Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [TSD-10 - Turbidity Click (Mikroe)]

4. Enable **Printf float**

   - Open Properties of the project.
   - Select C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → GNU ARM C Linker → General → Check **Printf float**.

5. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

### Driver Layer Diagram ###

![layer](image/driver_layer.png)

### Testing ###

The application monitors and displays Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). Results are being sent to the USART Terminal.

- The Turbidity sensor measures the amount of transmitted light to determine the turbidity of water. Program will read the NTU value. NTU value in a range of 0 to 4000 corresponds with the turbidity level of water (for example, 0 NTU means water is clean, and NTU is 3000 which means water is cloudy).

- You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below:

  ![console_log](image/log.png "log")

- Looking at the figure above, we can know the NTU value and determine the amount of soil in the water, depending on that, the controller can take some actions.
