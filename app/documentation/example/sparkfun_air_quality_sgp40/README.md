# SGP40 - Air Quality Sensor (Sparkfun) #

## Summary ##

This project shows the implementation of an SGP40 that is new digital VOC (volatile organic compounds) sensor designed for easy integration into air purifiers or demand-controlled ventilation, integrated into the Air Quality Sensor.

You can use this example as a reference for creating your own indoor air quality monitoring application. You can visualize the measured volatile organic compound (VOC) level by a display or you can transfer the measurements to a data center or mobile phone, which can trigger warning messages or start air freshener devices.

## Hardware Connection ##

For the Silicon Labs boards that feature a Qwiic connector, a [Qwiic Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/flexible-qwiic-cable-100mm.html) is used to connect to the SparkFun Air Quality board, as illustrated in the figure below.

![connection](image/hardware_connection.png)

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a Qwiic connector, consider using the [Qwiic Breadboard Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425).

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

**Silicon Labs BLE Development Kit:**

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by "sgp40".

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - SGP40 - Air Quality Sensor (Sparkfun)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/sparkfun_air_quality_sgp40/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting the existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Development Kit is used:**
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: vcom
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]
     - [Platform] → [Driver] → [I2C] → [I2CSPM] → default instance name: qwiic
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [SGP40 - Air Quality Sensor (Sparkfun)]

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [I2C] → [i2c2] → Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [SGP40 - Air Quality Sensor (Sparkfun)]

4. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output and an actual test image are shown in the figure below.

- Test the sensor and start to measure
