# A-172-MRQ - Fingerprint 2 Click (Mikroe) #

## Summary ##

This example project shows an example for Mikroe Fingerprint 2 Click board driver integration with Silicon Labs Platform.

The Mikroe Fingerprint 2 Click board is a fingerprint sensor module that allows for easy integration of fingerprint recognition functionality into a wide range of projects. It uses a high-quality A-172-MRQ fingerprint sensor that can quickly and accurately capture and compare fingerprints. The board includes an onboard microcontroller that handles all of the necessary processing, and it communicates with the host controller through an easy-to-use UART interface.

The board also includes some features such as the ability to store and match up to 24 fingerprints. It also includes two onboard LEDs to indicate the status of the sensor. This Click board can be used in various projects like security systems, attendance systems, access control etc and is a cost-effective solution for adding fingerprint recognition to your project.

## Hardware Connection ##

The Silicon Labs Explorer Kit boards feature a mikroBUS™ socket, allowing the Fingerprint 2 Click board to connect easily via the mikroBUS header. Ensure that the 45-degree corner of the Fingerprint 2 board aligns with the 45-degree white line on the Explorer Kit. The hardware connection is illustrated in the image below.

![board](image/hardware_connection.png)

For the Silicon Labs boards that do not have a mikroBUS™ socket, consider using the Wire Jumpers.

The tables below provide an overview of the pin connections.

## Setup ##

You can either create a project based on an example project or start with an empty example project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that the [Third Party Hardware Drivers](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension) extension is installed as part of the SiSDK. If not, follow [this documentation](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/third_party_hw_drivers_extension/blob/master/README.md#how-to-add-to-simplicity-studio-ide).
> - **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension must be enabled for the project to install the required components from this extension.

> [!TIP]
> To show all components in the **Third Party Hardware Drivers** extension, the **Evaluation** quality must be enabled in the Software Component view.

### Create a project based on an example project ###

1. From the Launcher Home, add your device to My Products, click on it, and click on the **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** tab. Find the example project filtering by *fingerprint*.

2. Click **Create** button on the **Third Party Hardware Drivers - A-172-MRQ - Fingerprint 2 Click (Mikroe)** example. Example project creation dialog pops up -> click Create and Finish and Project should be generated.

3. Build and flash this example to the board.

### Start with an empty example project ###

1. Create an "Empty C Project" for your board using Simplicity Studio v5. Use the default project settings.

2. Copy the file `app/example/mikroe_fingerprint2_a172mrq/app.c` into the project root folder (overwriting existing file).

3. Open the .slcp file. Select the **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** tab and install the following components:

   - **If the BLE Explorer Kit is used:**
     - [Services] → [Timers] → [Sleep Timer]
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: EUSART] → default instance name: **vcom**
     - [Services] → [IO Stream] → [IO Stream: USART] → default instance name: **mikroe** → Set "Receive buffer size" to 800
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Human Machine Interface] → [A-172-MRQ - Fingerprint 2 Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Assert]
     - [Application] → [Utility] → [Log]

   - **If the Wi-Fi Development Kit is used:**
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Service] → [Sleep Timer for Si91x]
     - [Third Party Hardware Drivers] → [Sensors] → [MM5D91-00 - Radar Click (Mikroe)] → use default configuration
     - [WiSeConnect 3 SDK] → [Device] → [Si91x] → [MCU] → [Peripheral] → [USART] → disable "USART0 DMA". Select the corresponding pins according to the table provided in [Hardware Connection](#hardware-connection)

4. Build and flash this example to the board.

## How It Works ##

### Driver Layer Diagram ###

![software layer](image/sw_layers.png)

### Testing ###

The example compares a fingerprint on input to the registered fingerprint and shows a message on the console screen on which input fingerprint is identified or on which input fingerprint is not identified.

You can launch Console that's integrated into Simplicity Studio or use a third-party terminal tool like Tera Term to receive the data from the USB. A screenshot of the console output is shown in the figure below.
